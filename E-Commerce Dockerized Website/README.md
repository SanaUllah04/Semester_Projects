## Architecture

This project uses a **microservices architecture**, with each service handling a specific domain:

- **Auth Service:** Handles user authentication and authorization.  
- **Product Service:** Manages product listings and inventory.  
- **Order Service:** Processes orders and integrates with payment and shipping.  
- **Payment Service:** Integrates with payment gateways.  
- **Shipping Service:** Manages shipping logistics.  
- **Notification Service:** Sends notifications to users.  
- **Frontend Service:** Serves the React application.  

Services communicate via **REST APIs**, and **MongoDB** is used as the database for each service.  
**Docker** is used to containerize each service, enabling easy deployment and scaling.
