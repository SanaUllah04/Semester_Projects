Architecture
This project uses a microservices architecture, with each service handling a specific domain:

Auth Service: Handles user authentication and authorization.
Product Service: Manages product listings and inventory.
Order Service: Processes orders and integrates with payment and shipping.
Payment Service: Integrates with payment gateways.
Shipping Service: Manages shipping logistics.
Notification Service: Sends notifications to users.
Frontend Service: Serves the React application.

The services communicate via REST APIs, and MongoDB is used as the database for each service. Docker is used to containerize each service, making it easy to deploy and scale.
